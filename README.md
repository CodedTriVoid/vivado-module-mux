Project Overview

This project demonstrates **fundamental FPGA digital design and verification practices** using a multiplexer (MUX) example implemented and simulated in **Xilinx Vivado**.

Rather than focusing on complexity, the intent of this project is to show **clean RTL design, structured testbenching, and an industry-appropriate workflow** suitable for FPGA and embedded systems roles.


The project emphasizes:

- Correct RTL modeling
- Explicit verification of functionality
- Awareness of design evolution and architectural intent
- Clean separation between source, testbench, and build artifacts
